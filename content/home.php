    <h1 itemprop="name" class="title"><em>Hurt: the inspiring, untold story of trauma care</em></h1>
    <p>Told through the eye of a surgeon who has flown on rescue helicopters, resuscitated patients in trauma centers in
        Houston and Chicago, and operated on hundreds of trauma victims of all ages, HURT takes us on a tour of the
        advancements in injury treatment from the battlefields of the Civil War to the state-of-the-art trauma centers
        of today.</p>
    <blockquote>
        "Musemeche's fast-paced medical history mixes the gritty reality of treating life-threatening injuries—including her own heart-pounding experiences as surgeon—with an unfettered optimism about what trauma care can now promise: an assurance that most people will survive even a devastating injury."

    <blockquote>"Dr. Musemeche has woven together history, personal narrative, and surgical anatomy with the deftness of a master of craft."

    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>"Operating on infants is not as simple as learning how to sew in minature," explains Musemeche in this fascinating, frequently hair-raising account of the state of pediatric surgery. Musemeche has been working in the field for three decades and writes with the kind of drama that feels as visceral as viewing a documentary."
